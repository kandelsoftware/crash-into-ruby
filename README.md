This is a one-day crash-course for Ruby beginners and intermediates. It will take you all the way through from basic Ruby coding, to the secrets of the object model, and up to advanced metaprogramming techniques. Whether you're a Java developer, a Python guru, or a JavaScript wizard, this workshop will show you what's the big deal about Ruby, why people love it so much, and why idiomatic Ruby code looks... different.

This is a hands-on experience, so bring your own computer with Ruby installed.
