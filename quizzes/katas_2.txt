GUESS THE NUMBER (The computer guesses)
Write a program that asks you to come up with a number between 1 and 100, and then tries to guess it. You must tell the program whether the number is too high (by inputting ">"), too low ("<") or just right ("="). For bonus points, make the program better at understanding whether you're cheating: if your answers are inconsistent, the program shoudl complain.
