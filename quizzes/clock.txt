GRANDFATHER CLOCK
Write a GrandfatherClock class that has a configurable alarm. When you create the clock, you pass it a block, like this:
  clock = GrandfatherClock.new { puts 'DONG!' }

Then you set the time of the day, like this:
  clock.time = 20
  
After you configure the clock, you can call:
  clock.chime
  
Now the clock will execute the method once at 1pm, four times at 4am, and so on.
