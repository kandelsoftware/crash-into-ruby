# Here is a pretty hard quiz. Make this code pass without an exception:

# TODO: write your code here

raise "WRONG!" unless 1 + 1 == 3

# I'm serious.
#
# You're not allowed to touch the line of code above. Before that line,
# you can write any code you like.
#
# (Hint: you'll probably need to use the alias_method() method).
